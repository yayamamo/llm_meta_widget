# Does the Rails partial render the element with the right attributes?
#
# The gem's job is now to turn keyword options into attributes, and the mapping
# has three cases that fail quietly if they regress — the same three config.js
# is tested on, approached from the other side. config.test.mjs checks how the
# element READS attributes; this checks how the gem WRITES them. A mismatch
# between the two would leave the widget misconfigured with nothing failing.
#
# Standalone, like the scripts in test/e2e: `ruby test/partial_render_test.rb`.
# No Rails: it loads the REAL helper module and the REAL partial, stubbing only
# what Rails would otherwise provide.
#
# The first version of this file reimplemented tag_attr/well_known_attr as test
# shims, which made it vacuous — breaking the shipped helper left every check
# green. Load the real thing, or the test tests itself.
